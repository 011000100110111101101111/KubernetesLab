# KubernetesLab

## Current State

- Abstracted configuration to simple config file.
- Can deploy and retreive ssh keys for machines while listing packages etc.

## Next steps

- Add wrapper on top to combine envirements.
  - IE a single run will deploy
    - 1 kali machine (key is retreived)
    - X exposed machines / services
  - This can then be run X times, creating X envirements.
